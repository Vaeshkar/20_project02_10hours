## Functional Requirements

### FR001 â€” Figma Wireframe Creation

## Development Guidelines
- **Daily Stand-ups:** Organize short daily meetings to synchronize progress.
- **Kanban Board:** Maintain a clear and updated Trello board to track all tasks.
- **Communication:** Use Slack Huddles and channels for instant communication.
